# Useless-Clock
Code for the Useless Clock
Consists of code from: Rinky-Dink Electronics, vishalsoniindia, embeddedlab786, and probably more.

Make sure you download the latest version!!
Lots of improvements!! (Still sucks tho lol)


To do list (Any team member can make changes and then send me the code and I will try it...)

                        \/ NECESSARY CHANGES!!! \/

1. Add the ability to turn the alarm off after turning it on...  ¯\\ _(ツ) _/¯

                       \/ OPTIONAL CHANGES!!! \/

1. Add EEPROM to the code so that the clock will save alarm settings whenever it gets unplugged from the wall...

2. Button presses occasionally don't register because of long delay commands to make the numbers flash while changing them...

3. Add some way to do 12 hour time? It's currently 24 hour time..

4. When setting the time or alarm if the hours or minutes go below zero it just goes into the negatives instead of resetting back at 60 minutes or 24/12 hours...

5. Any general usability improvements that y'all can think of...
