# Useless-Clock
Code for the Useless Clock
Consists of code from: Rinky-Dink Electronics, vishalsoniindia, embeddedlab786, and probably more.

Make sure you download the latest version!!
Lots of improvements!! (Still sucks tho lol)


To do list (Any team member can make changes and then send me the code and I will try it...)

                        \/ NECESSARY CHANGES!!! \/

1. Add the ability to turn the alarm off after turning it on... (lol)

                        \/ OPTIONAL CHANGES!!! \/

1. Add EEPROM so that the clock will save alarm settings whenever it gets unplugged from the wall...

2. Buttons occasionally don't register because of long delay commands to make the numbers flash while changing them...

3. Any general usability improvements that y'all can think of...
